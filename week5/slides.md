# What `type_of` Error?
In Rust there are two main types of errors we care about: recoverable and unrecoverable errors (panics).
* `Result<V, E>` - A return type for recoverable errors
* `panic!` - A macro (*notice the `!`*) to invoke unrecoverable errors

![bg right:30% 80%](../images/ferris_panics.svg)

---


# The Result Type
This is how Rust represents "success" and "failure" states in code.
```rust 
enum Result<V, E> {
    Ok(V),
    Err(E),
}
```
## Example with error messages
```rust
fn integer_divide(a : i32, b : i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    Err("Divide by zero") if b == 0 else Ok(a/b)
}
```

---


# The ? Operator
The `?` operator when applied to a result type, unwraps it on a `Ok` and propogates the error up one in the call stack otherwise.

For clarity:
```rust
let x = potential_fail()?;
```
de-sugars to
```rust
let x = match potential_fail() {
    Ok(v) => v
    Err(e) => return Err(e.into()), // Error is propogated up a level
}
```
Think of the `?` as quick way to see where a function short-circuit returns on failure

---
# The ? Operator
We can also chain multiple `?` together:
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}
```

---

# Panics
Panics in Rust are unrecoverable errors. They can happen in many different ways:
* Out of bounds slice indexing
* Integer overflow (debug)
* `.unwrap()` on a `None` or `Err`
* Calls to the `panic!` macro

---
# More Panics
- `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!` conditionally panic

There also some more uncommon, but useful macros that panic:
- `unimplemented!` / `todo!` - self documented
- `unreachable!` - Lets the compiler optimize a code segment away
---

# Using `expect()` w/ Panics
Consider the following example from the Rust book:
```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
}
```
What happens if we don't have `"hello.txt"`?
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os {
code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }',
src/main.rs:4:49
```

---

# Using `expect()` w/ Panics
We can do better than this. If we *expect* this error and have a specific message in mind.
```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
        .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
}
```
Now we get:
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'hello.txt should be included in this project: Os {
code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }',
src/main.rs:5:10
```

---

# Functions that never return
Consider the following code, what should the type of `x` be?
```rust
let x = loop { println!("forever"); };
```

---

# The "Never" Type - `!`
It isn't clear, right? That's why Rust has a special type called `!` for this exact reason.
Another example:
```rust
fn bar() -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

---

# What's the point?
Why have a type that never has a value? Consider the following
```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```
Recall match statements can only return 1 type. So what's happening here? Well, `continue` has the `!` type. And so Rust knows this can't be value and allows 
`guess: u32`. 

---

# What else uses `!`?
Recall that `()` is a value! So `print!` and `assert!` don't use `!`.

* `panic!`
* `break`
* `continue`
* Everything that doesn't return a value -- typically control flow related.

---

# Pop Quiz
What should the type of `x` be?
```rust
let x = {
    return 123
};
```

---

# Answer
`return` is also type `!`. So `let x : ! = ...` would compile. 

Think of it like this because `return` returns from the **entire function**, `x` can be given type `!`

---

# **Traits**

---

# Trait Overview
A `trait` is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: `Self`. They can access other methods declared in the same trait.

Traits are defined with the `trait` keyword:
```rust
trait Shape {
    // Associated function signature; `Self` refers to the implementor type.
    fn new_unit() -> Self;

    // Method signature to be implemented by a struct.
    fn area(&self) -> f32;

    fn name(&self) -> String;

    // Default method implementation -- can be overriden
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("{} has an area of {}", self.name(), self.area());
    }
}
```

---
# Trait Overview
So how do we use traits? We `impl`ement them `for` a `struct`
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    height : f32,
    width : f32
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    // Notice how 'Self' is now 'Rectangle' since it's the implementor
    fn new_unit() -> Rectangle { 
        Rectangle { height : 1.0, width : 1.0 }
    }

    ...
    
    // We can override functions defined in the trait 
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("I am a rectangle! :)");
    }
}
```

---

# Traits in Action
What happens we try and construct a `Rectangle`?
```rust
let rec = Shape::new_unit();
```

```
error[E0790]: cannot call associated function on trait 
without specifying the corresponding `impl` type
  --> src/main.rs:43:15
   |
8  |     fn new_unit() -> Self;
   |     ---------------------- `Shape::new_unit` defined
```
![bg right:30% 80%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

---

# Traits in Action
```rust
let rec : Rectangle = Shape::new_unit();
```
Traits, even those that define their functions, cannot be constructed directly. To use the `Shape` trait, Rust must know who is implementing it.

Similar in style to:
- Interfaces
- Abstract/virtual classes

---
# Type Aliases
Rust gives us a way to declare a type alias i.e. give a name to an already existing type.
```rust
type Kilometers = i32;

let x: i32 = 5;
let y: Kilometers = 5;

println!("x + y = {}", x + y); // Rust knows the types are really the same
```

---

# Advanced Traits
We'll look at the common `Iterator` trait which uses an *associated type* `Item`.
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

---

# Advanced Traits
Here we see the associated type `Item` being defined for a particular instance. This means the `Iterator` trait can be defined for any `Item` depending on the collection.
```rust
impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // --snip--
```

---

# Why Not Use Generics?
Some of you may be wondering why the Rust std library doesn't define the `Iterator` trait like this:
```rust
pub trait Iterator<T> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T>;
}
```
There's nothing technically wrong with this -- it will compile. 

Here's the issue, it would be possible to implement both `Iterator<i64> for Counter` **and** `Iterator<u32> for Counter` !

---

# Why Is This Bad?
When we use the `next()` method on `Counter`, we would have to provide type annotations to indicate which implementation of `Iterator` we want to use.

By using an associated type, we only implement `Iterator` once -- Note that we can define `Item` to be a generic type instead.

Associated types also become part of the traitâ€™s contract: implementors of the trait must provide a type to stand in for the associated type placeholder. Associated types often have a name that describes how the type will be used, and documenting the associated type in the API documentation is good practice.

---

# Derive Traits
The compiler is capable of providing basic implementations for some traits via the 
`#[derive]` attribute. These traits can still be manually implemented if a more complex behavior is required.

Here's a list
- Comparison traits: `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`.
- `Clone`, to create `T` from `&T` via a copy.
- `Copy`, to give a type 'copy semantics' instead of 'move semantics'.
- `Hash`, to compute a hash from `&T`.
- `Default`, to create an empty instance of a data type.
- `Debug`, to format a value using the `{:?}` formatter.

---

# Copy
Recall `copy` only applies to:
- All integer types: `u8`, `i32`, etc
- `bool`
- All floating point types: `f32`, `f64`, etc
- `char` type

It is a differentiator in whether or not move semantics are applied to a function. (aka pass by reference vs value)

---

# Clone
* Means the type can be duplicated 
* Creates a new value with the same information as the original. 
* The new value is independent of the original value and can be modified without affecting the original value.
```rust
let mut foo = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut foo2 = foo.clone(); // explicit duplication of an object

foo.push(4); // foo = [1,2,3,4]
let y = foo2.pop(); // y=3, foo2 = [1, 2]
```

---
# Clone vs Copy
Although their end result may feel the same they are different:

Copy
* Copies happen implicitely ex: `x = y`
* Copy cannot be overloaded it is always a simple bitwise copy

Clone
* Cloning is an explicit action `x.clone()`
* `Clone` can provide any type-specific behavior necessary to duplicate values safely.
    * An example of this is for `String`, `Clone` would need to copy not just the pointer but the data on the heap.
---

# So How Do You `#[derive]` Clone?
Any type made out of types that implement `Clone` can use the `#[derive]` -- This is a general rule for derivation.

Example:
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Cat {
    age: u32,
    name: String
}
```
Note how in this example `Cat` can't implement `Copy` since a `String` can't be copied.

---

# A Brief Break w/ Super Traits
Rust doesn't have "inheritence", but you can define a trait as being a superset of another trait.

```rust
trait Person {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
}

trait Student: Person {
    fn university(&self) -> String;
}
```
`Person` is a supertrait of Student. This means implementing `Student` requires you to also `impl Person`.

---

# Even Superer Traits
```rust
trait Programmer {
    fn fav_language(&self) -> String;
}

// CompSciStudent is a subtrait of both Programmer 
// and Student.
trait CompSciStudent: Programmer + Student {
    fn git_username(&self) -> String;
}
```
We can make a trait a subtrait of multiple traits with the `+` operator. Implementing CompSciStudent will now require you to `impl` both supertraits.

---

# What Can `#[derive]` Copy?
Any type made out of types that implement Copy or a it holds a shared reference `&T`. 

**Clone is a supertrait of Copy**
So if we want to derive one, we have to derive the other.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Cat {
    age: u32,
    name: &'static str // reference to a string literal
}
```

# Trait Mix Ups
Consider the following
```rust
trait Pilot {
    fn fly(&self);
}

trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;
```

---

# Trait Mix Ups
```rust
impl Pilot for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("This is your captain speaking.");
    }
}

impl Wizard for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Up!");
    }
}

impl Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("*waving arms furiously*");
    }
}
```

---

# Trait Mix Ups
What happens here?
```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    person.fly();
}
```

---

# Trait Mix Ups
```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    person.fly();
}
```
`*waving arms furiously*` - Rust used `.fly()` from `Human`.


How do we call every version of `.fly()`?
```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    Pilot::fly(&person); // fly takes &self as a parameter
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    person.fly();
}
```

---

# Even Worse Trait Mix Ups
Last time we got lucky because `fly` took `&self` as a parameter. What would we do if that wasn't the case?

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    <person as Pilot>::fly();
    <person as Wizard>::fly();
    person.fly();
}
```

This is considered the *fully qualified syntax* of a trait. 

---

# Trait Bounds
If your function is generic over a trait but you don't mind the specific type, you can simplify the function declaration using `impl Trait` as the type of the argument.

Instead of
```rust
fn get_csv_lines<R: std::io::BufRead>(src: R) -> u32
```
We can write:
```rust
fn get_csv_lines(src: impl std::io::BufRead) -> u32
```

---

# Trait Bounds
If your function returns a type that implements `MyTrait`, you can write its return type as `-> impl MyTrait`. This can help simplify your type signatures a lot!

```rust
fn combine_vecs(
    v: Vec<i32>,
    u: Vec<i32>,
) -> impl Iterator<Item=i32>
```
