# Week 10

![bg right:50% 80%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ We're in week 10! ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

Thank you all for sticking with us!


---


# The Story So Far...

* We have covered all of the basic features of Rust, as well as many of the intermediate concepts
* If you are confident you understand the past 9 lectures, you can probably say you are proficient with Rust!
* Now for the _really_ interesting stuff...


---


# Finale

Here is the plan for the last ~3.5 lectures:

1) `unsafe`
2) Parallelism
3) Concurrency
4) Macros


---


# Epilogue

As much as we'd love to dive deep into each of these topics in depth, we simply do not have time.

However...
* The goal of this course was never to feed you information
* The goal was to teach you the _core ideas_ of Rust and how to think about it
* We hope that you will take the knowledge from this class and use it to explore more about this programming language _yourself_


---


# Final Project

Here are the high-level details about the final project:

* We would like you to spend 6-8 hours developing a project of your choosing
    * _This means a good faith attempt at completing a project_
    * _This bound includes time spent planning and thinking!_
* Your project should incorporate 1 of the 4 advanced topics we will talk about
    * _We can make exceptions if you have a specific idea_
* _If you have less than 400 homework points, you will need to do this_
* More details to come later!


---


# Back to `unsafe`...


---


# Into the Woods

So far, we've only seen code where memory safety is guaranteed at compile time.

* Rust has a second language hidden inside called _unsafe Rust_
* `unsafe` Rust does not enforce memory safety guarantees


---


# Why `unsafe`?

* Static analysis is _conservative_
* By definition, it enforces _soundness_ rather than _completeness_
* We need a way to tell the compiler: "Trust me, I know what I'm doing"
* Additionally, computer hardware is inherently unsafe


---


# `unsafe` in 2024

* Rust's precise requirements for `unsafe` code are still being determined
* There's an entire book dedicated to `unsafe` Rust called the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)


---


# What is `unsafe`, really?

If you take anything away from today, it should be this:

**Unsafe code is the mechanism Rust gives developers for taking advantage of invariants that, for whatever reason, the compiler cannot check.**

- _Jon Gjengset, Rust for Rustaceans_


---


# What `unsafe` is not

It's important to understand that `unsafe` is not a way to skirt the rules of Rust.

* Ownership
* Borrow Checking
* Lifetimes
* `unsafe` is a way to _enforce_ these rules using reasoning beyond the compiler
* The onus is on _you_ to ensure the code is **safe**

<!--
unsafe is a misleading keyword: it's not that the code _is_ unsafe, it is that the
code is allowed to perform otherwise unsafe operations because in this particular context,
those operations _are_ safe
-->


---


# The `unsafe` Keyword

There are 2 ways to use the `unsafe` keyword in Rust. The first is marking a function as `unsafe`.

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.some_usize -= 1;
    }
}
```

* Here, the `unsafe` keyword serves as a warning to the caller
* There may be additional invariants that must be upheld before calling `decr`


---


# The `unsafe` Keyword

The second way is marking an expression as `unsafe`

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```


---


# The `unsafe` Contracts

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.some_usize -= 1;
    }

    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```

* The first requires the caller to be careful
* The second assumes the caller _was_ careful when invoking `decr`


---


# The `unsafe` Contracts

Imagine is `SomeType<T>` was really `Rc<T>`:

```rust
impl<T> Rc<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.count -= 1;
    }

    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```

* When `self.count` hits 0, `T` is dropped
* What if someone else constructed `&T` without incrementing `count`?
* As long as nobody corrupts the reference count, this code is safe


---


# Unsafe Superpowers

So what can we do with `unsafe`?

With `unsafe`, we get 5 superpowers! We can:

1) Call an `unsafe` function or method
2) Access or modify a mutable static variable
3) Implement an `unsafe` trait
4) Access fields of `union`s


---

# Unsafe Superpowers

1. Call an `unsafe` function or method
2. Access or modify a mutable static variable
3. Implement an `unsafe` trait
4. Access fields of `union`s

These 4 things aren't all that interesting, so why the big fuss?


---


# **THE** UNSAFE SUPERPOWER

The **biggest** superpower of all is superpower 5!

* **Dereference a raw pointer**
* ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ `That's it` ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
* _But honestly, it's enough to wreak all sorts of havoc_


---


# Raw Pointers

Unsafe Rust has 2 types of Raw Pointers:

* `*const T` is an immutable raw pointer
* `*mut T` is a mutable raw pointer
* _Note that the asterisk `*` is part of the type name_
* _Immutable_ here means that the pointer can't directly be reassigned after being dereferenced


---


# Pointers vs References

Raw Pointers themselves are allowed to do some special things:

* They can ignore borrowing rules by have multiple immutable and mutable pointers to the same location
* They are not guaranteed to point to valid memory
* They don't implement any automatic cleanup
* They can be `NULL` ðŸ’€


---


# Raw Pointers Example

Here's an example of creating raw pointers.

```rust
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;
```

* We have both an immutable and mutable pointer pointing to the same place
* Notice how there is no `unsafe` keyword here
* We can _create_ raw pointers safely, we just cannot _dereference_ them


---


# Raw Pointers Example

Here is another example of creating a raw pointer.

```rust
let address: usize = 0xDEADBEEF;
let r = address as *const i32;
```

* We construct a pointer to (likely) invalid memory
* Again, no `unsafe` keyword necessary here!


---


# Raw Pointers and `unsafe`

Let's actually try and dereference these pointers.

```rust
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

unsafe {
    println!("r1 is: {}", *r1);
    println!("r2 is: {}", *r2);
}
```

* There's no undefined behavior here? Right?
* _Right?_
* ðŸ¦€ Right ðŸ¦€


---


# TODO

* Calling `unsafe` functions
    * FFI with C
* Writing an `unsafe` function (`split_at_mut`)
* What could go wrong?
    * A lot


---


# Calling `unsafe` Functions

Calling `unsafe` functions is similar, we must call them in an `unsafe` block.

```rust
unsafe fn dangerous() {}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        dangerous();
    }
}
```

* We would get an error if we called `dangerous` without the `unsafe` block!


---


# Using `extern` Functions

Sometimes, we might need to interact with code from another language.

* Rust has the keyword `extern` that facilitates the use of a _Foreign Function Interface (FFI)_
* Since other languages will not have Rust's safety guarantees, we have no idea if they are safe to call or not!


---


# `extern "C"`

Let's see how we would set up integration with the `abs` function from the C standard library.

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!("Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}", abs(-3));
    }
}
```

* The `"C"` defines the _Application Binary Interface (ABI)_ that the external function uses
* We have no idea if `abs` is doing what it is supposed to be doing, so it is on us as the programmer to ensure safety


---


# `extern "C"`

We can also use `extern` to allow other languages to call Rust code!

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call_from_c() {
    println!("Just called a Rust function from C!");
}
```

* Note how the usage of `extern` does not require `unsafe`


---


# Mutable Static Variables

We can mutate global static variables with `unsafe`.

```rust
static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;

fn add_to_count(inc: u32) {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += inc;
    }
}

fn main() {
    add_to_count(3);

    unsafe {
        println!("COUNTER: {}", COUNTER);
    }
}
```


---


# Last 2 Superpowers

The last 2 superpowers are implementing an `unsafe` trait and accessing fields of a `union`.

* We may or may not cover `unsafe` traits next week
    * (specifically `Send` and `Sync`)
* `union`s are primarily used to interface with unions in C code


---


# How to use `unsafe` code

* Just because a function contains `unsafe` code doesn't mean need to mark the entire function as `unsafe`
* Often, we want to write `unsafe` code that we know is actually safe
* A common abstraction is to wrap `unsafe` code in a safe function


---


# `split_at_mut`

Let's take a look at `split_at_mut` from the standard library.

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let r = &mut v[..];

let (a, b) = r.split_at_mut(3);

assert_eq!(a, &mut [1, 2, 3]);
assert_eq!(b, &mut [4, 5, 6]);
```


---


# `split_at_mut`

```rust
fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]);
```

* Unfortunately, we cannot write this function using only safe Rust
* How would we attempt it?


---


# `split_at_mut` Implementation

```rust
fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
}
```

* What is the issue with this?
* Can you figure out what the compiler will tell us _just by looking at the function signature_?


---


# `split_at_mut` Compiler Error

If we try to compile, we get this error:

```
$ cargo run

# `split_at_mut` Implementation

Let's try again with `unsafe`.

```rust
use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();
    let ptr = values.as_mut_ptr();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    unsafe {
        (
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}
```


---


# `split_at_mut` Implementation

```rust
unsafe {
    (
        slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
        slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
    )
}
```

* `from_raw_parts_mut` is `unsafe` because it takes a raw pointer and must trust it is valid
* Since the `ptr` came from a valid slice, we know it is valid!


---


# `from_raw_parts_mut` Safety Contract

Here is the actual safety contract for `from_raw_parts_mut`:

```rust
/// # Safety
///
/// Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:
///
/// * `data` must be [valid] for both reads and writes for `len * mem::size_of::<T>()` many bytes,
///   and it must be properly aligned. This means in particular:
///
///     * The entire memory range of this slice must be contained within a single allocated object!
///       Slices can never span across multiple allocated objects.
///     * `data` must be non-null and aligned even for zero-length slices. One
///       reason for this is that enum layout optimizations may rely on references
///       (including slices of any length) being aligned and non-null to distinguish
///       them from other data. You can obtain a pointer that is usable as `data`
///       for zero-length slices using [`NonNull::dangling()`].
///
/// * `data` must point to `len` consecutive properly initialized values of type `T`.
///
/// * The memory referenced by the returned slice must not be accessed through any other pointer
///   (not derived from the return value) for the duration of lifetime `'a`.
///   Both read and write accesses are forbidden.
///
/// * The total size `len * mem::size_of::<T>()` of the slice must be no larger than `isize::MAX`,
///   and adding that size to `data` must not "wrap around" the address space.
///   See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].
```


---


# `from_raw_parts_mut` Misuse

We could very easily misuse `from_raw_parts_mut` if we wanted to...

```rust
use std::slice;

let address: usize = 0xDEADBEEF;
let r = address as *mut i32;

let values: &[i32] = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts_mut(r, 10000) };
```

* This might seem ridiculous, but when you always assume your code is safe...
