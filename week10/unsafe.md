# **Unsafe Rust**

# Week 10

![bg right:50% 80%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ We're in week 10! ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€

Thank you all for sticking with us!


---


# The Story So Far...

* We have covered all of the basic features of Rust, as well as many of the intermediate concepts
* If you are confident you understand the past 9 lectures, you can probably say you are proficient with Rust!
* Now for the _really_ interesting stuff...


---


# Finale

Here is the plan for the last ~3.5 lectures:

1) `unsafe`
2) Parallelism
3) Concurrency
4) Macros


---


# Epilogue

As much as we'd love to dive deep into each of these topics in depth, we simply do not have time.

However...
* The goal of this course was never to feed you information
* The goal was to teach you the _core ideas_ of Rust and how to think about it
* We hope that you will take the knowledge from this class and use it to explore more about this programming language _yourself_


---


# Final Project

Here are the high-level details about the final project:

* We would like you to spend 6-8 hours developing a project of your choosing
    * _This means a good faith attempt at completing a project_
* Your project should incorporate 1 of the 4 advanced topics we will talk about
    * _We can make exceptions if you have a specific idea_
* _If you have less than 400 homework points, you will need to do this_
* More details to come soon*!

# Back to `unsafe`...


---


# Into the Woods

So far, we've only seen code where memory safety is guaranteed at compile time.

* Rust has a second language hidden inside called _unsafe Rust_
* `unsafe` Rust does not enforce memory safety guarantees


---


# Why `unsafe`?

* Static analysis is _conservative_
* By definition, it enforces _soundness_ rather than _completeness_
* We need a way to tell the compiler, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing"
* Additionally, computer hardware is inherently unsafe


---


# `unsafe` in 2024

* Rust's precise requirements for `unsafe` code are still being determined
* There's an entire book dedicated to `unsafe` Rust called the [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/)






---


# What is `unsafe`, really?

If you take anything away from today, it should be this:

**Unsafe code is the mechanism Rust gives developers for taking advantage of invariants that, for whatever reason, the compiler cannot check.**

- _Jon Gjengset, Rust for Rustaceans_


---


# What `unsafe` is not

It's important to understand that `unsafe` is not a way to skirt the rules of Rust.

* Ownership
* Borrow Checking
* Lifetimes
* `unsafe` is a way to _enforce_ these rules using reasoning beyond the compiler
* The onus is on _you_ to ensure the code is **safe**

<!--
unsafe is a misleading keyword: it's not that the code _is_ unsafe, it is that the
code is allowed to perform otherwise unsafe operations because in this particular context,
those operations _are_ safe
-->


---


# The `unsafe` Keyword

There are 2 ways to use the `unsafe` keyword in Rust. The first is marking a function as `unsafe`.

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.some_usize -= 1;
    }
}
```

* Here, the `unsafe` keyword serves as a warning to the caller
* There may be additional invariants that must be upheld before calling `decr`


---


# The `unsafe` Keyword

The second way is marking an expression as `unsafe`

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```


---


# The `unsafe` Contracts

```rust
impl<T> SomeType<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.some_usize -= 1;
    }

    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```

* The first requires the caller to be careful
* The second assumes the caller _was_ careful when invoking `decr`


---


# The `unsafe` Contracts

Imagine is `SomeType<T>` was really `Rc<T>`:

```rust
impl<T> Rc<T> {
    pub unsafe fn decr(&self) {
        self.count -= 1;
    }

    pub fn as_ref(&self) -> &T {
        unsafe { &*self.ptr }
    }
}
```

* When `self.count` hits 0, `T` is dropped
* What if someone else constructed `&T` without incrementing `count`?
* As long as nobody corrupts the reference count, this code is safe


---


# Unsafe Superpowers

So what can we do with `unsafe`?

With `unsafe`, we get 5 superpowers! We can:

1) Call an `unsafe` function or method
2) Access or modify a mutable static variable
3) Implement an `unsafe` trait
4) Access fields of `union`s


---

# Unsafe Superpowers

1. Call an `unsafe` function or method
2. Access or modify a mutable static variable
3. Implement an `unsafe` trait
4. Access fields of `union`s

These 4 things aren't all that interesting, so why the big fuss?

# **THE** UNSAFE SUPERPOWER

The **biggest** superpower of all is superpower 5!

* **Dereference a raw pointer**
* ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ `That's it` ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
* _But honestly, it's enough to wreak all sorts of havoc_

# Raw Pointers

Unsafe Rust has 2 types of Raw Pointers:

* `*const T` is an immutable raw pointer
* `*mut T` is a mutable raw pointer
* _Note that the asterisk `*` is part of the type name_
* _Immutable_ here means that the pointer can't directly be reassigned after being dereferenced


---


# Pointers vs References

Raw Pointers themselves are allowed to do some special things:

* They can ignore borrowing rules by have multiple immutable and mutable pointers to the same location
* They are not guaranteed to point to valid memory
* They don't implement any automatic cleanup
* They can be `NULL` ğŸ’€


---


# Raw Pointers Example

Here's an example of creating raw pointers.

```rust
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;
```

* We have both an immutable and mutable pointer pointing to the same place
* Notice how there is no `unsafe` keyword here
* We can _create_ raw pointers safely, we just cannot _dereference_ them


---


# Raw Pointers Example

Here is another example of creating a raw pointer.

```rust
let address: usize = 0xDEADBEEF;
let r = address as *const i32;
```

* We construct a pointer to (likely) invalid memory
* Again, no `unsafe` keyword necessary here!


---


# Raw Pointers and `unsafe`

Let's actually try and dereference these pointers.

```rust
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

unsafe {
    println!("r1 is: {}", *r1);
    println!("r2 is: {}", *r2);
}
```

* There's no undefined behavior here? Right?
* _Right?_
* ğŸ¦€ Right ğŸ¦€

# TODO

* Calling `unsafe` functions
    * FFI with C
* Writing an `unsafe` function (`split_at_mut`)
* What could go wrong?
    * A lot
