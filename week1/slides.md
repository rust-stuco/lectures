#### Benjamin Owad, David Rudo, and Connor Tsui


---


# **Welcome!**

<!--
Introductions here
Talk a bit about ourselves
-->

* Ferris is Rust's mascot,
and ours too!

# **Why Rust?**

<!-- Why are you all here? -->


---


# Why Rust?

<!--
This section is heavily influenced by Jon Gjengset's talk about Considering Rust:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT-LUQgc7s
-->

* What is Rust?
* How does Rust compare to other languages?
* What are the biggest advantages of Rust?
* What are the pitfalls of Rust?
* Who is Rust for?


---


# What is Rust?

* Rust started as a personal project of Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla Research employee, in 2006
* Mozilla sponsored the project in 2009, and released the source code in 2010
* The first stable release, Rust 1.0, was announced in 2015

* From the official rust [website](rust-lang.org), Rust is:
    * Fast
    * Reliable
    * Productive

<!-- There is a saying: Fast, reliable, or productive - pick three! -->


<!-- * "is blazingly fast and memory-efficient" (**_fast_**)
* "enabl[es] you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time" (**_reliable_**)
* "has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling" (**_productive_**)
* "[is] A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software" -->


---


# What is Rust?

* Compiled language
* No runtime (no garbage collector)
* Imperative, but with functional features
* Strong static typing


---


# Rust vs Python

* Significantly faster
* Much lower memory use
* Multi-threaded
* Comprehensive type system


---


# Rust vs Java

* No runtime overhead from the JVM or a garbage collector
* Much lower memory use
* Zero-cost abstractions
* First-class support for modern paradigms


---


# Rust vs C/C++

* No segfaults!
* No null pointers!
* No buffer overflows!
* No data races!
* Memory safety as a guarantee through the type checker
* Robust type system with functional patterns
* Unified build system and dependency management


---


# Rust Is Memory Safe

* _"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off"_
    * Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++
* Safety by default makes it much harder to shoot yourself in the foot
* Memory accesses checked at compile-time
* Powerful type system supports thread safety



---

# Rust Is Low-Level

* Compiles to machine code
* No runtime (no garbage collector)
* Memory can be allocated deliberately
* Support for raw pointers
* Support for inline assembly
* Zero-overhead FFI


---


# Rust Is Modern

* Rust is only 9 years old
* Algebraic and generic data types
* Modern developer tooling
<!-- Built-in unit testing and documentation, friendly errors -->
* Included build system and dependency management
* Asynchronous execution as a first-class language feature
* Macros / metaprogramming support


---


# Pitfall: Learning curve

* Writing Rust _feels_ very different
* The borrow checker can get in your way
* No object oriented programming
* **That is what we are here for!**

<!--
The borrow checker can feel "unfair" and hard
Requires thinking a lot up front before you write down code
-->


---


# Pitfall: Ecosystem

* Rust is only 9 years old
* Smaller and less mature ecosystem compared to some older languages
    * _There is a lot of momentum here_


---


# Other pitfalls

* Compile time is slow
* Using established C++ libraries requires complicated bindings
* Programming in a systems language still takes more time than in a higher-level language


---


# Who is Rust for?

* Rust is for those who benefit from its great features, and do not suffer from its pitfalls

* Rust is intended to be fast, reliable, and productive
* Rust targets complex programs while providing stability and security
* **Which means Rust is _not_ for everyone**

<!-- Rust is not a magic bullet to solve everyone's problems -->


---


# Course Goals

By the end of the semester, we want you all to:

* Be able to read, write, and reason about Rust code
* Become an intermediate to advanced Rust developer
* Understand the importance of the Rust language
* Be confident that you can use Rust going forward!


---


# **Cargo Basics**


---


# Hello World!

To create an executable, we need a `main` function:

```rust
// main.rs

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

<br>

To compile `main.rs`, use `rustc`.

```sh
$ rustc main.rs
```


---


# Cargo


<!--
Compare Rust and cargo to other languages like Python and pip, or C/C++ and cmake
-->


Rust has its own build system and package manager called **Cargo**.

* Cargo is included with all Rust distributions, so no `make` files or third-party build systems
* Manages packages similar to `pip` for `python` or `npm` for `node.js`


---


# Creating a new project

To create a new cargo project called `hello_cargo`, use `cargo new`.

```sh
$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
```

* You will find a few important things
    * `.git` repository and `.gitignore`
    * `Cargo.toml`
    * `src/main.rs`
* We will come back `Cargo.toml` in future weeks


---


# Building your project

To build your project, use `cargo build`.

```
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (<path>/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.00s
```

* This creates an executable file at `target/debug/hello_cargo`
<!-- * To build for release, run `cargo build --release` -->
* What if we want to actually run this executable?
    * We could run `./target/debug/hello_cargo`, but this is a lot to type...


---


# Running your project

To run your project, use `cargo run`.

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
```

* Note that if you compiled with `cargo build` right before, you wouldn't see the `Compiling hello_cargo ...` line
<!-- * To run in release, run `cargo run --release` -->


---


# Check if your project compiles

To check your code for syntax and type errors, use `cargo check`

```
$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
```

* Much faster than `cargo build` since it doesn't build the executable
* Useful when programming to check if your code still compiles


---


# Cargo recap

* We can create a project using `cargo new`
* We can build a project using `cargo build`
* We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`
* We can check a project for errors using `cargo check`
* Cargo stores our executable in the `target/debug` directory


---


# **Variables and Mutability**


---


# Variables

Variables are values bound to a name. We define variables with the `let` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```


---


# Immutability

All variables in Rust are _immutable_ by default.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

* What happens when we try to compile this?


---


# Immutability

When we try to compile, we get this error message:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

* Let's follow the compiler's advice!


---


# Mutability

![bg right:25% 80%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

To declare a variable as mutable, we use the `mut` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

When we run the program now, we now get this:

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```


---


# Constants

Like immutable variables, constants are values bound to a name.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

* Constants cannot be `mut`
* Constants must have an explicit type
    * We will talk about types like `u32` in a few slides


---


# Scopes and Shadowing

You can create nested scopes within functions with curly braces `{}`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

* Let's dissect this!


---


```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
{
    let x = x * 2;
    println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
}
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
```

* `x` is bound to `5` first
* A new variable `x` is created and bound to `x + 1`, i.e. `6`
* An inner scope is created with the opening curly brace `{`
* The third `let` statement shadows `x`
* The shadowed `x` is set to `x * 2 = 12`
* The inner scope ends with the closing curly brace `}`
* `x` returns to being 6 again


---


```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
{
    let x = x * 2;
    println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
}
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
```

<br>

Let's run this now!

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```


---


# Aside: Shadowing vs Mutability

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Mutability:

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

```
  |
2 |     let mut spaces = "   ";
  |                      ----- expected due to this value
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`
  |
```

* Expected one _type_, got something else
    * We'll talk about types in a few slides!


---

# Aside: Shadowing vs Mutability

![bg right:25% 80%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

Shadowing:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```
- Even though the types are different, the `let` keyword allows us to redefine the `spaces` variable


---


# Shadowing vs Mutability

* Mutability lets us change the value of a variable
    * We get a compile time error if we try to modify a non-`mut` variable
* Shadowing allows us to change what a variable's name refers to
    * In addition to changing the value, it can also change types

<!--
So what are types then?
-->


---


# **Types**


---


# Types

Like most languages, there are two main categories of Data Types.

- Scalar Types
    - Integers
    - Floating-Points
    - Boolean
    - Character
- Compound Types
    - Tuples
    - Arrays


---


# Integers

Rust has similar integer types you would expect to see in C.

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |


---


# Floating-Points

Rust has both a 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```


---


# Numeric Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder / modulo
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```


---


# Integer Casting


Rust has no implicit type conversion (coercion). However, we can explicitly convert types using the `as` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let decimal: f32 = 65.4321;

    let integer = decimal as u8;
    let character = integer as char;

    println!("{}, {}, {}", decimal, integer, character);
}
```

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
65.4321, 65, A
```


---


# Booleans

A _boolean_ in Rust has two values `true` and `false` (as in most other languages).

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

* Booleans are always 1 byte in size

---


# Characters

Rust has a UTF-32 character type `char`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```

* Use `char` with single quotes (`'a'` vs. `"a"`)
* Due to `char` being UTF-32, a `char` is always **4 bytes in length**
* We will talk more about this and UTF-8 / UTF-32 in the future!



---


# Tuples

A _tuple_ is a way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```


---


# Tuples

You can destructure tuples like so:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```


---


# Tuples

You can also access specific elements in the tuples like so:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```


---


# Arrays

To store a collection of multiple values, we use _arrays_.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
                  "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
}
```

* Unlike tuples, all elements must be the same type
* The number of elements is always fixed at compile time
    * If you want a collection that grows and shrinks, use a vector (lecture 4)
* Similar to stack-allocated arrays you would see in C


---


# Arrays

We define an array's type be specifying the type of the elements and the length of the array.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

We can also initialize the array such that every element has the same value.

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
// let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
```


---


# Arrays

To access an array element, we use square brackets.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

<!--
Note that Rust might not explicitly check at runtime since the compiler could optimize the check away
The reason why that is important is no buffer overflows!
-->

* Rust will ensure that the index is within bounds at runtime
   * This is _not_ done in C/C++


---


# **Functions, Statements, and Expressions**



---


# Functions

Like most programming languages, Rust has functions.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
Hello, world!
Another function.
```


---


# Functions

All parameters / arguments to functions must be given an explicit type.

```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {}{}", value, unit_label);
}
```

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
The measurement is: 5h
```


---


# Returning from Functions

You can return values back to the caller of a function with the `return` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + 1;
}
```

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
The value of x is: 6
```


---

# Returning from Functions

You can also omit the `return` keyword.

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

```
$ cargo run
    <-- snip -->
The value of x is: 6
```

<!--
Is this just syntactic sugar for programmers who are too lazy to write the `return` keyword?
-->

* Why are we allowed do this?


---


<!--
TODO be more precise: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/reference/statements-and-expressions.html
-->


# Statements and Expressions

All functions are a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 6; // Statement
    let y = 2 + 2; // Statement resulting from the expression "2 + 2"
    2 + 2; // Expression ending in a semicolon,
           // which turns the expression into a statement with no effect
}
```
* **Statements** are instructions that do some action and don't return a value
* **Expressions** evaluate / return to a resultant value


---


# Statements and Expressions

- Statements
    * `let y = 6;` is a statement and does not return a value
    * You _cannot_ write `x = y = 6`
* Expressions
    * `2 + 2` is an expression
    * Calling a function is an expression
    * A scope is also an expression
* If you add a semicolon to an expression, it turns into a statement
* If a scope is an expression, can scopes return values?


---


# Statements and Expressions

Observe the following code where a scope returns a value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

* Notice that there is no semicolon after `x + 1`
* Scopes return the value of their last expression
* Since functions are scopes, they can also return values in this way!


---


# Function Return Types

Let's revisit this code snippet.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

<!--
Note that in C, no return type is the `void` type.
Rust aligns much more with type theory and thus uses the unit type `()` instead!
-->

* Functions must have a specific return value, or return nothing
    * No return type is equivalent to returning the unit type `()`
* Notice again that there is no semicolon after `x + 1`


---


Suppose we did add a semicolon:

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

We get this error:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:24
  |
7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |
---

---
--            ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`
  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
8 |     x + 1;
  |          - help: remove this semicolon to return this value
```


---


# **Control Flow**


---


# `if` Expressions

We can define runtime control flow with `if`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```


---


# `if` Expressions

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

`if` expressions must condition on a boolean expression.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
  |
4 |     if number {
  |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer
```


---


# `else if` Branching

You can handle multiple conditions with `else if`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```


---


# `if`s are Expressions!

Since `if` expressions are expressions, we can bind the result of an `if` expression to a variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

* `if` expressions must always return the same type in all branches


---


# Loops

There are 3 kinds of loops in Rust.
- `loop`
- `while`
- `for`


---



# `loop` loops

`loop` will loop forever until you tell it to stop with `break`.

<!--
Like `while (true)` in other languages
-->

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break;
        }
    }

    println!("The counter is {}", counter);
}
```

* `break` and `continue` apply to the innnermost loop where they are called


---


# `loop`s are Expressions

Like everything else, you can return a value from a `loop`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```


---


# Loop Labels

You can label loops to use with `break` and `continue` to specify which loop it applies to.

```rust
fn main() {
    'outer: loop {
        println!("Entered the outer loop");

        'inner: loop {
            println!("Entered the inner loop");
            // break; // <-- This would break only the inner loop

            // This breaks the outer loop
            break 'outer;
        }

        println!("This point will never be reached");
    }
    println!("Exited the outer loop");
}
```


---


```rust
fn main() {
    'outer: loop {
        println!("Entered the outer loop");
        'inner: loop {
            println!("Entered the inner loop");
            break 'outer;
        }
        println!("This point will never be reached");
    }
    println!("Exited the outer loop");
}
```

```
Entered the outer loop
Entered the inner loop
Exited the outer loop
```

* Applies to `while` and `for` loops too


---


# `while` loops

Just like other languages, we have `while` loops that stop after some condition.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```


---


# `for` loops

We can also loop through collections with a `for` loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

# `for` loops and ranges

To loop over a range, use the `..` syntax to create a range.

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in 1..4 {
        println!("{}...", number);
    }
    println!("SURPRISE!!!");
}
```

<!--
There are no C-style for loops in Rust
`while` and `for` loops are specific syntactic sugar, and `for` loops in particular have some
certain nuances that we will talk about in future weeks.

# Course Logistics: Homework

* Homeworks are designed to take less than an hour per week
    * If you are spending more than that, please let us know!
* Autograded assignments through Gradescope
* 7 late days
    * _You can ask us for more late days if you ask in advance..._

<!--
We may or may not give late days out like candy :D
Still doesn't change the fact that assignments need to be turned in
no more than a week after they were officially due (unless there is an
extenuating circumstance)
-->

# Course Logistics: Homework Solutions

* We have made homework solutions **public**
* We **strongly encourage** students to avoid looking at these solutions
* Give a good-faith attempt at the homework before resorting to this
* You will not learn anything from copying and pasting our code
    * _We will catch you, and we are required to report you to the university_


---


# Homework 1

* This first homework consists of 8 small puzzles and 4 simple function implementations
* The objective is to build confidence with Rust syntax and experience interpreting error messages
* Refer to `README.md` for further instructions
* Please let us know if you have any questions!
