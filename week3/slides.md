# Review: Ownership

* Manual memory management is tricky
    * Prone to memory leaks or double frees
* Garbage collection is slow and unpredictable
* What if the compiler generated allocations and frees for us?
    * Rust does this for us through the _ownership_ system


---


# Review: Ownership Rules

* Each value in Rust has an _owner_
* A value can only have one owner at a time
* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be _dropped_


---


# Review: Borrowing Rules

* At any given time, you can have either:
    * One mutable reference (exclusive reference)
    * Any number of immutable references (shared references)
* Memory access through references is guaranteed to be valid


---


# Review Question 1

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Why doesn't this compile?

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("yo");
    taker(s);
    println!("I *totally* still own {}", s);
}

fn taker(some_string: String) {
    println!("{} is mine now!", some_string);
}
```


---


# Review Question 1

```
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s`
 --> src/main.rs:4:42
  |
2 |     let s = String::from("yo");
  |         - move occurs because `s` has type `String`,
  |           which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     taker(s);
  |           - value moved here
4 |     println!("I *totally* still own {}", s);
  |                                          ^ value borrowed here after move
  |
```
* Looks like `taker` does not still own `s`, after all


---


# Review Question 1

```
note: consider changing this parameter type in function `taker` to borrow
      instead if owning the value isn't necessary
 --> src/main.rs:7:23
  |
7 | fn taker(some_string: String) {
  |    -----              ^^^^^^ this parameter takes ownership of the value
  |    |
  |    in this function
```

* Suggestion from the compiler: Rewrite `taker` to _borrow_ `some_string`
* Is it necessary for `taker` to own the value?


---


# Review Question 1 (References Solution)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("yo");
    taker(&s);                   // <-- Change to pass a reference to a String
    println!("I *totally* still own {}", s);
}

fn taker(some_string: &String) { // <-- Change to expect a reference to a String
    println!("{} is mine now!", some_string);
}
```
* Let `taker` borrow the value instead of moving it and transferring ownership


---


# Review Question 1 (Alternative Solution)

```
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
  |
3 |     taker(s.clone());
  |            ++++++++
```

* Making a clone (deep copy) allows this compile
    * If `s` represents a large `String`, cloning will be expensive


---


# Review Question 2

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Why doesn't this compile?

```rust
fn main() {
    let favorite_computers = Vec::new();
    add_to_list(favorite_computers,
        String::from("Framework Laptop"));
}

fn add_to_list(fav_items: Vec<String>, item: String) {
    fav_items.push(item);
}
```


---


# Review Question 2

```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `fav_items` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
 --> src/main.rs:8:5
  |
8 |     fav_items.push(item);

  |
help: consider changing this to be mutable
  |
7 | fn add_to_list(mut fav_items: Vec<String>, item: String) {
  |                +++
```

* Missing one `mut` annotation


---


# Review Question 2 (Solution)

```rust
fn cool_guy() {
    let favorite_computers = Vec::new();
    add_to_list(favorite_computers, String::from("Framework Laptop"));
}

//             +++ Add `mut` here
fn add_to_list(mut fav_items: Vec<String>, item: String) {
    fav_items.push(item);
}
```


---


# Review Question 2b

```rust
fn cool_guy() {
    let favorite_computers = Vec::new();
    add_to_list(favorite_computers, String::from("Framework Laptop"));
    println!("{:?}", favorite_computers); // <-- I want to print this!
}

fn add_to_list(mut fav_items: Vec<String>, item: String) {
    fav_items.push(item);
}
```

- What if we want to print the list?
* `favorite_computers` was moved in the `add_to_list` call
* Same issue as review question 1


---


# Review Question 2b (Solution)

Let's try a mutable reference instead of moving the entire value.

```rust
fn cool_guy() {
    let favorite_computers = Vec::new();
    add_to_list(&mut favorite_computers, String::from("Framework Laptop"));
    println!("{:?}", favorite_computers);
}

fn add_to_list(fav_items: &mut Vec<String>, item: String) {
    fav_items.push(item);
}
```

* This now works as intended!


---


# Review Question 3

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Why doesn't this compile?

```rust
fn i_dont_exist() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let x = &v[3];
    v.pop(); // Removes last element in `v`
    println!("{}", x); // What is `x`?
}
```


---


# Review Question 3

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let x = &v[3];
  |              - immutable borrow occurs here
4 |     v.pop(); // Removes last element in `vec`
  |     ^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{}", x); // What is `x`?
  |                    - immutable borrow later used here
```

* We cannot mutably borrow a value with an existing immutable borrow
* In this case, if it were allowed, `x` would point to invalid memory!

<!--
These sorts of errors are caught at compile time!
-->


---


# Review Question 3b

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

What about this scenario?

```rust
fn please_dont_move() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let x = &v[2];
    v.push(4); // Add an element to the end of `v`
    println!("{}", x); // What is `x`?
}
```

* This time we aren't removing the last element, instead we're adding more elements!
    * Surely nothing happens to `x` this time, right?


---


# Review Question 3b

We still get the same error!

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
3 |     let x = &v[2];
  |              - immutable borrow occurs here
4 |     v.push(4);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     println!("{}", x); // What is `x`?
  |                    - immutable borrow later used here
```

* In this case, what if pushing `4` onto `v` resizes the entire vector?
    * Resizing means allocating new memory, copying over data, then deallocating the old memory
* `x` would no longer point to valid memory!


<!--
What if, as the programmer, you knew that the vector initially has capacity 8,
and that this push doesn't resize?

The compiler has no way of knowing that, but you do!

If you really want this code to work, there is a specific keyword, `unsafe`, that lets you do this.
We will talk about `unsafe` in the later weeks.

# **Structs**


---


# Structs

A _struct_ is a custom data type that lets you package together and name related values that make up a meaningful group.

```rust
struct Student {
    andrew_id: String,
    attendance: Vec<bool>,
    grade: u8,
    stress_level: u64,
}
```

* To define a struct, we enter the keyword `struct` and name the entire group
* Within the curly braces, we define _fields_
* Each field is named and has an associated type

<!-- Very similar to C structs -->


---


# Instantiating Structs

We can create an _instance_ of a struct using the name of the struct and `key: value`
pairs inside curly brackets.

```rust
fn init_connor() -> Student {
    Student {
        andrew_id: String::from("cjtsui"),
        stress_level: u64::MAX,
        grade: 80,
        attendance: vec![true, false, false, false, false, false, false],
    }
}
```

* You don't have to specify fields in any order
* You _must_ define every field of the struct to create an instance


---


# Accessing Fields

We can access fields of a struct using dot notation.

```rust
fn init_connor() -> Student {
    let mut connor = Student {
        andrew_id: String::from("cjtsui"),
        stress_level: u64::MAX,
        grade: 80,
        attendance: vec![true, false, false, false, false, false, false],
    };

    connor.grade = 60; // shh
    println!("{} has grade {}", connor.andrew_id, connor.grade);

    connor
}
```

* Note that the entire instance must be `mut` to modify _any_ field


---


# Field Init Shorthand

We can use _field init shorthand_ to remove repetitive wording.

```rust
fn init_student(andrew_id: String, grade: u8) -> Student {
    Student {
        andrew_id,
        grade,
        attendance: Vec::new(),
        stress_level: u64::MAX, // 😔
    }
}
```
* We can shorten `andrew_id: andrew_id` to simply `andrew_id`


---


# Struct Update Syntax

There is a shorthand to use values from an existing struct to create a new one.

```rust
fn relax_student(prev_student: Student) -> Student {
    Student {
        stress_level: 0,
        grade: 100,
        ..prev_student
    }
}
```

* Note that this moves the data of the old struct
    * `prev_student` is moved, so we can't use it again (_unless..._)

<!--
There is a way to make it not moved, if it is Copyable
How do we make a struct Copy?
Stay tuned to find out!
-->


---


# Tuple Structs

We can created named tuples called "tuple structs".

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let red = Color(255, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

* The same as structs, except without named fields
* The same as tuples, except with an associated name


---


# Unit Structs

We can declare "unit structs" as such:

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

* Structs that have no fields
* Most commonly used as markers since they are zero-sized types

<!--
Isomorphic to the unit type ()
Useful when you want to implement a trait, but don't need to store any data with it
-->


---


# References in Structs

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Can we store references inside structs?

```rust
struct Student {
    andrew_id: &str, // <- &str instead of String
    attendance: Vec<bool>,
    grade: u8,
    stress_level: u64,
}
```


---


# Lifetimes Sneak Peek

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:2:16
  |

  |                ^ expected named lifetime parameter
  |

1 ~ struct Student<'a> {
2 ~     andrew_id: &'a str, // <- &str instead of String
```

* We can store references in structs, but we need lifetime specifiers
    * We will talk about these in Week 7!


---


# Struct Example

```rust
fn draw_rectangle(x: u32, y: u32, width: u32, height: u32) {}
```

```rust
fn draw_rectangle(rect_tuple: (u32, u32, u32, u32)) {}
```

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn draw_rectangle(rect: Rectangle) {}
```
* Which do you prefer?

<!-- Just with regard to code style... -->


---


# Printing Structs

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

What if we wanted to print these structs for debugging?

```rust
struct Student {
    andrew_id: String,
    attendance: Vec<bool>,
    grade: u8,
    stress_level: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let connor = init_connor();

    println!("{:?}", connor);
}
```

<!--
All they need to know about `:?` is that it is used for debugging purposes
-->


---


# Printing Structs

We get an error if we try to print something that is not printable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let connor = init_connor();

    println!("{:?}", connor);
}
```

```
error[E0277]: `Student` doesn't implement `Debug`
  --> src/main.rs:11:22
   |
11 |     println!("{:?}", connor);
   |                      ^^^^^^ `Student` cannot be formatted using `{:?}`
   |
   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Student`
```


---


# Traits Sneak Peek

What's this all about?

```
error[E0277]: `Student` doesn't implement `Debug`
<-- snip -->
   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Student`
```

* More on traits in Week 5!
    * They define shared functionality and behavior between types


---


# Derived Traits

As is often the case, the compiler provides a helpful suggestion.

```
help: consider annotating `Student` with `#[derive(Debug)]`
   |
2  + #[derive(Debug)]
3  | struct Student {
   |
```

* For now, let's just follow the advice blindly


---


# Derived Traits

As a quick overview, derived traits allow us to quickly add functionality to our types.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Student {
    andrew_id: String,
    attendance: Vec<bool>,
    grade: u8,
    stress_level: u64,
}
```

* We can _derive_ a trait using the `derive` macro
* This will allow us to print this struct!


---


# Derived Traits

We can try again now:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Student {
    // <-- snip -->
}

fn main() {
    let connor = init_connor();

    println!("{:?}", connor);
}
```

```
Student { andrew_id: "cjtsui", attendance: [true, false], grade: 80, stress_level: 18446744073709551615 }
```

* We are given a relatively nice output for free!


---


# **Struct Methods**


---


# Struct Methods

Suppose we wanted to write a function that was only dependent on the data inside a single instance of a struct.

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
```

* What if we wanted to get the area of this rectangle?


---


# Struct Methods

_Methods_ are like functions, but their first parameter is always `self`, and they are always defined within the context of a struct.

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```


---


# Method Syntax

Let's dive a bit deeper into this:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

* We start with an `impl` block for `Rectangle`
* We use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`
    * `&self` is actually syntactic sugar for `self: &Self`
    * In `impl` blocks, `Self` is shorthand for the type being implemented
    * So `&Self` is the same as `&Rectangle`


---


# Calling Methods

We can call a method using dot notation.

```rust
fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { x: 0, y: 0, width: 42, height: 98 };

    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
}
```

* Note that we don't need to pass anything in for `self`


---


# Consuming Methods

What would happen if we didn't borrow with `&self` and instead use `self`?

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 42, height: 98 };
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    // println!("Width: {}", rect.width); <-- Cannot do this
}
```

* We take in `self` and "consume" it by taking ownership

<!--
There are cases where you might want this,
for example if you want something to be done only once and
you want to prevent it from happening twice (like a initialization of a protocol)
-->


---


# `&mut self`

We can take a mutable reference to our struct as well.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn change_width(&mut self, new_width: u32) {
        self.width = new_width;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle { x: 0, y: 0, width: 42, height: 98 };
    rect.change_width(100);

    println!("{:?}", rect);
}
```
* Follows the same rules for mutable references as before


---


# Associated Functions


We can define an _associated function_ in `impl` blocks that do not take `self`.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn create_square(x: u32, y: u32, side_length: u32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y, width: side_length, height: side_length }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let square = Rectangle::create_square(0, 0, 213);
}
```

* A reminder that `Self` is shorthand for `Rectangle` here
* We cannot use dot notation for these functions
    * Instead we use the struct name and the `::` operator

<!--
Also known as static methods in other languages
Often used for "constructors" that return a new instance of the struct
-->


---


# Aside: What About `->`?

```rust
p1.distance(&p2);
(&p1).distance(&p2); // This is the same!
```

* In C and C++, you use `.` for direct access and `->` for access through a pointer
* Rust instead has _**automatic referencing and dereferencing**_
* When you call `object.something()`, Rust will automatically add in the `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so that `object` matches the signature of the method
    * Makes ownership and borrowing more ergonomic


---


# **Enums**


---


# Enums

* Defines a type with multiple possible _variants_
* Manifestation of the algebraic data type known as the "sum type"
    * Structs are "product types"
* Sum types hold a value that takes on one of several distinct variants.
    * Think of sum types as a value that can be of type A ___or___ B


---


# Enum Definition

IP addresses have two major standards, IPv4 and IPv6.

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

* IP addresses can be _either_ IPv4 _or_ IPv6
* We can express this concept in code with an enum consisting of V4 and V6 variants
* In general, we enumerate variants of a sum type as fields in an enum

<!--
Express that variants are equivalent to distinct types from previous slide
-->


---


# Enum Variants

We can make a value of type `IpAddrKind` as such:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

* The `::` operator represents a _namespace_
    * `V4` is in the namespace of `IpAddrKind`
* Useful syntax, because we can see both values are of the same type: `IpAddrKind`


---


# Enum Variants

We can define a function that takes an `IpAddrKind`:

```rust
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
```

And call it with any of the variants:

```rust
route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
```


---


# Enums vs Structs

At the moment, `IpAddrKind` only encodes the _kind_ of address, and the address itself has to be stored elsewhere.

We could do this using structs:

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4, // IPv4 addresses look like `8.8.8.8`
    V6, // IPv6 addresses look like `2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888`
}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}
```

* When we have an `IpAddr` struct, we could check the `kind` field to determine how to interpret the `address` field

<!--
That works for this example, but what if V4 and V6 variants require different types?
-->


---


# Enums Can Hold Data

Instead of using structs to hold data, we can have the enums themselves hold data.

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

* Much cleaner than before!

<!--
This is equivalent to a tagged union data structure now
-->


---


# Enum Associated Data

Each enum can also hold different types and different amounts of data.


```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

* Cleaner than carrying around a `String` that we need to parse


---


# Aside: `std::net::IpAddr`

The Rust Standard Library actually has its own implementation of `IpAddr`.

```rust
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```


---


# Enum Example

Let's take a look at another example of an enum that models data with variants.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

* `Quit` has no associated data
* `Move` has named fields like a struct
* `Write` includes a single `String`
* `ChangeColor` includes 3 `i32` values


---


# Enums vs Structs

How would this look if we just used structs?

```rust
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```

* Each of these structs has a separate type
    * We couldn't easily define a function to take in all of these types


---


# Enum Methods

We can define `impl` blocks for enums as well as structs.

```rust
struct Message {
    Write(string),
    // <-- snip -->
}

impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // <-- snip -->
    }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```

* `self` holds the value of the enum
    * Same borrowing semantics as with structs


---


# **The Option Type**


---


# `NULL`

`NULL` is a pointer that does not point to a valid object or value.

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake...
My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler.
But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement.
This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
— Tony Hoare, "inventer of `NULL`", 2009

* The issue is not the concept of `NULL`, rather its _implementation_
* We still want a way to express that a value could be _something_ **or** _nothing_

---


# The Option Type

The standard library defines an enum `Option<T>`:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

* We can return either `None` or `Some`, where `Some` contains a value
* The `<T>` is a generic type parameter which means it can hold any type

# The Option Type

Here are some examples of `Option<T>`:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

let some_number = Some(5);
let some_char = Some('e');

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```

* Rust will infer that `some_number` has type `Option<i32>` and `some_char` has type `Option<char>`
* We still have to annotate `absent_number` with `Option<i32>`


---


# `Option<T>` vs `NULL`

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

So why is `Option<T>` better than `NULL`? Consider this:

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = x + y;
```

* What might be wrong with this?


---


# `Option<T>` vs `NULL`

If we try to compile this, we get an compile-time error.

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = x + y;
```

```
error[E0277]: cannot add `Option<i8>` to `i8`
 --> src/main.rs:6:17
  |
6 |     let sum = x + y;
  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option<i8>`
  |
  = help: the trait `Add<Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`
```

* Instead of runtime error, we catch the error immediately at compile time!


---


# Working With `Option<T>`

We still need a way to extract the number out of the `Some(5)`.

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);
let sum = x + y;

if y.is_none() {
    // do something
} else if y.is_some() {
    // How do we even extract the `5` out???
    // Something like `y.get() + x`???
}
```

* This syntax is also kind of ugly...

<!-- Cough cough C++ std::optional -->

# **Pattern Matching**


---


# `match`

Rust has a powerful control flow construct called `match`.

* You can compare a value against a series of patterns
* You can execute code based on which pattern matches
* Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, etc.

<!--
Patterns can be made up of values or structures

It's like a coin-sorting machine, where the coin rolls down
and will fall into the hole that fits it first
-->


---


# Pattern Matching

Here's an example of a coin sorting function that returns the value of the coin.

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```


---


# Pattern Matching

Let's break this down:

```rust
match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
}
```

* First we write `match`, followed by an expression (in this case `coin`)
* Similar to `if` branch, but the expression does not need to be a `bool`
* Each arm has a pattern, followed by `=>`, followed by another expression
    * The patterns here are the `Coin` enum variants
    * The expressions here are just the values of each coin

---


# Pattern Matching

Here's another similar example.

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    let res = match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny!");
            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    };
    res
}
```

* The `match` arms can be any valid expression, including code blocks!


---


# Binding Patterns: Quarters

Patterns can bind to specific parts of the values that match the pattern.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // Allows us to print `UsState`
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState), // Quarters have states on them
}
```


---


# Binding Patterns: Quarters

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```

* We bind the variable `state` to the `UsState` that the `Quarter` variant holds!


---


# Binding Patterns: `Option<T>`

Let's revisit the example from before.

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = match y {
    Some(num) => Some(x + num),
    //   ^^^ `num` binds to 5
    None => None,
};

println!("{:?}", sum); // Prints "Some(10)"
```

* Clean, and we can access the value in the `Some` variant easily


---


# Matches Are Exhaustive

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

The `match` patterns must cover all possible values that the matched expression may take.

What happens when we miss a case?

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = match y {
    Some(num) => x + num,
};
```


---


# Matches Are Exhaustive

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = match y {
    Some(num) => x + num,
};
```

```
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
   --> src/main.rs:6:21
    |
6   |     let sum = match y {
    |                     ^ pattern `None` not covered
```

* Forces us to explicitly handle the `None` case
* Protecting us from the billion-dollar mistake!


---


# Catch-all Pattern

Sometimes we don't need to do something special for every case, and can instead have a fallback case.

```rust
fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}

let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    other => move_player(other),
}
```

* `other` matches anything not covered by previous patterns


---


# `_` Pattern

If we don't need the matched value, we can use `_` instead.

```rust
fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}

let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => reroll(),
}
```

* `_` matches anything, but it doesn't bind the value


---


# Concise Control Flow with `if let`

Sometimes we just want to match against 1 pattern while ignoring the rest.

`if let` provides a more concise way to do this:

```rust
if let Coin::Penny = coin {
    println!("Lucky penny!");
}
```

* Works with `else if let <pattern> = <expr>` and `else` as well


---


# `if let` Example

Here's another example of the same program written 2 different ways:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
    _ => count += 1,
}
```

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```

# Pattern Matching

Pattern Matching is an incredibly powerful tool.

* Gives you more utilities for managing a program’s control flow
* Allows you to you quickly and cleanly case on structures, typically enums
* Very useful for compilers and parsers
* Rust has many more patterns than we have time to cover!
    * Read [Chapter 18](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html) of the Rust Book to find out more!
        * _Will take less than 20 minutes_

# Homework 3

* This is the first homework where you will need to actually synthesize code!
* You have been tasked with implementing two types of Pokemon:
    * `Charmander` struct
    * `Eevee` struct that can evolve into `EvolvedEevee`
        * `EvolvedEevee` is an enum representing different evolutions
* We _highly_ recommend reading [Chapter 18](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html) of the Rust book if you have time!
