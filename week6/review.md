# Quiz Answers and Review

* For any of the "does this compile" questions, try to compile it yourself and see what happens!
* Generally, the error messages are very helpful
* Use [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021) if you want to do it online!


---


# Today

* We will go over questions 4, 6, 8, and 9
* If you want to ask about other questions please ask on Piazza!


---


# Question 1

Determine whether the program will pass the compiler.

```rust
fn add_suffix(mut s: String) -> String {
    s.push_str(" world");
    s
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = add_suffix(s);
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```


---


# Question 1 Answer

```rust
fn add_suffix(mut s: String) -> String {
    s.push_str(" world");
    s
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = add_suffix(s);
    println!("{}", s2);
}
```

* Answer:
    * `hello world`
* Reason:
    * Just a normal program (warmup question)


---


# Question 2

Determine whether the program will pass the compiler.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2;
    let b = false;
    if b {
        s2 = s;
    }
    println!("{}", s);
}
```


---


# Question 2 Answer

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2;
    let b = false;
    if b {
        s2 = s;
    }
    println!("{}", s);
}
```

* Answer:
    * `does not compile`
* Reason:
    * Try compiling it yourself! The error message is pretty good
    * Remember, even if the programmer can guarantee something, the compiler might not know about that guarantee!


---


# Question 2 Brown Explanation

Because `s` could be moved inside of the if-statement, it is illegal to use it on line 8.

While the if-statement will never execute in this program because `b` is always `false`, Rust does not in general try to determine whether if-statements will or won't execute.

Rust just assumes that it *might* be executed, and therefore `s` *might* be moved.


---


# Question 3

_This question is tricky._

Say we have a function that moves a box, like this:

```rust
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

* Note that a `Box` is just like any owned type we've dealt with
* Notably, the `Box` is moved into the function and then dropped at the end
    * This means that the data the `Box` owns on the heap is _freed_
*   _It's on us if you didn't know that, but if you got it wrong before because of that, now is the time to think about this question more!_


---


# Question 3 (A)

Imagine if Rust allowed this snippet to compile and run.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

```rust
// A
let b = Box::new(0);
let b2 = b;
move_a_box(b);
```


---


# Question 3 Answer (A)

```rust
// A
let b = Box::new(0);
let b2 = b;
move_a_box(b);
```

* Answer:
    * Yes, this would cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * If `b2 = b` is executed, and we don't invalidate `b`, then we have 2 pointers to the same place on the heap
    * `move_a_box(b)` frees the memory on the heap
    * At the end of the outer scope, `b2` gets freed
    * Double free!


---


# Question 3 (B)

Imagine if Rust allowed this snippet to compile and run.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

```rust
// B
let b = Box::new(0);
let b2 = b;
println!("{}", b);
move_a_box(b2);
```


---


# Question 3 Answer (B)

```rust
// B
let b = Box::new(0);
let b2 = b;
println!("{}", b);
move_a_box(b2);
```

* Answer:
    * No, this would not cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * Running `b2 = b` doesn't change the data on the heap, so we could still access the memory that `b` points to
    * Also, since we "moved" `b` into `b2`, Rust will not call `drop` on `b`, so we don't get a double free


---


# Question 3 (C)

Imagine if Rust allowed this snippet to compile and run.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

```rust
// C
let b = Box::new(0);
move_a_box(b);
let b2 = b;
```


---


# Question 3 Answer (C)

```rust
// C
let b = Box::new(0);
move_a_box(b);
let b2 = b;
```

* Answer:
    * Yes, this is undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * We free the memory that `b` points to, and then set `b2` to point to freed memory
    * Double free!


---


# Question 3 (D)

Imagine if Rust allowed this snippet to compile and run.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
    // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

```rust
// D
let b = Box::new(0);
move_a_box(b);
println!("{}", b);
```


---


# Question 3 Answer (D)

```rust
// D
let b = Box::new(0);
move_a_box(b);
println!("{}", b);
```

* Answer:
    * Yes, this would cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * We are trying to read freed memory


---


# Question 3 Brown Explanation

The key idea is that when a box is passed to `move_a_box`, its memory is freed after `move_a_box` ends.

Therefore:
* Reading `b` via `println` after `move_a_box` is undefined behavior, as it reads freed memory.
* Giving `b` a second owner is undefined behavior, as it would cause Rust to free the box a second time on behalf of `b2`. It doesn't matter whether the `let b2 = b` binding happens before or after `move_a_box`.

However, doing `let b2 = b` and then `println` is not undefined behavior. Although `b` is moved, its data is not freed until `move_a_box` is called at the end. Therefore this program is technically safe, although still rejected by Rust.


---


# Question 4

Determine whether the program will pass the compiler.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = &s;
    let s3 = &mut s;
    s3.push_str(" world");
    println!("{s2}");
}
```


---


# Question 4 Answer

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = &s;
    let s3 = &mut s;
    s3.push_str(" world");
    println!("{s2}");
}
```

* Answer:
    * `does not compile`


---


# Question 5

_This question is tricky._

Consider this Rust function that pushes a number onto the end of a vector, and then removes and returns the number from the front of the vector:

```rust
fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(n);
    v.remove(0)
}
```


---


# Question 5

Normally, if you try to compile this function, the compiler returns the following error:

```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*v` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
 --> test.rs:2:5
  |
1 | fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
  |                     --------- help: consider changing this to be a
                                        mutable reference: `&mut Vec<i32>`
2 |     v.push(n);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ `v` is a `&` reference,
        so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
```


---


# Question 5 (A)

Assume the compiler did NOT reject this function.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(n);
    v.remove(0)
}
```

```rust
// A
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let n = &v[0];
give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", n);
```


---


# Question 5 Answer (A)

```rust
fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(n);
    v.remove(0)
}

// A
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let n = &v[0];
give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", n);
```

* Answer:
    * Yes, this would cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * `v.push` might reallocate the `Vec`
    * `n` would point to invalid memory


---


# Question 5 (B)

Assume the compiler did NOT reject this function.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(n);
    v.remove(0)
}
```

```rust
// B
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2 = &v;
give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", v2[0]);
```


---


# Question 5 Answer (B)

```rust
// B
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2 = &v;
give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", v2[0]);
```

* Answer:
    * No this would not cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * Observe that `v2` is a reference to `v`, NOT a reference to heap memory
    * So even if `v` resizes, `v2` still points to `v`, which points to valid memory


---


# Question 5 (C)


Assume the compiler did NOT reject this function.

Would this snippet cause undefined behavior?

```rust
fn give_and_take(v: &Vec<i32>, n: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(n);
    v.remove(0)
}
```

```rust
// C
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let n = &v[0];
let k = give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", k);
```

---


# Question 5 Answer (C)

```rust
// C
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let n = &v[0];
let k = give_and_take(&v, 4);
println!("{}", k);
```


* Answer:
    * No this would not cause undefined behavior
* Reason:
    * We never use `n` after creating it, so this is perfectly safe


---


# Question 5 Brown Explanation

As we saw earlier in the section, `v.push(n)` can cause `v` to reallocate its internal contents, invalidating any references to the elements of `v` on the heap.

Therefore calling `give_and_take(&v, 4)` will cause previously-created element references to point to invalid memory. The two programs that bind `let n = &v[0]` before `give_and_take` are candidates for undefined behavior. `let v2 = &v` is not a candidate because a reference to the container `v` is not actually invalidated by mutating `v`.

The program that does `println!("{}", n)` will cause undefined behavior by reading the invalid memory. The program that does `println!("{}", k)` will not cause undefined behavior, because it does not use the invalidated reference.


---


# Question 6

Let's say a programmer tried writing the following function:

```rust
/// Returns a person's name with "Ph.D." added as a title
fn award_phd(name: &String) -> String {
    let mut name = *name;
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
    name
}
```

The Rust compiler rejects their code with the following error:

```text
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*name` which is behind a shared reference
 --> test.rs:3:20
  |
3 |     let mut name = *name;
  |                    ^^^^^
  |                    |
  |                    move occurs because `*name` has type `String`,
                       which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  |                    help: consider borrowing here: `&*name`
```


---


# Question 6 Answer

What is the most idiomatic fix to the program? Remember, we want to return a _new_ name, and the old name should not be modified.

Answer:

```rust
// A
fn award_phd(name: &String) -> String {
    let mut name = name.clone();
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
    name
}
```


---


# Question 6 Incorrect Answer (B)

Option B doesn't compile:

```rust
// B
fn award_phd(name: &String) -> String {
    let mut name = &*name;
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
    name
}
```

```

---


# Question 6 Incorrect Answer (C & D)

Options C and D both mutate the original `String`, instead of creating a new one:

```rust
// C
fn award_phd(mut name: String) -> String {
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
    name
}
```

```rust
// D
fn award_phd(name: &mut String) {
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
}
```

# Question 7

_This question is tricky._

The following program does not compile:

```rust
fn copy_to_prev(v: &mut Vec<i32>, i: usize) {
    let n = &mut v[i];
    *n = v[i - 1];
}

fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    copy_to_prev(&mut v, 1);
}
```


---


# Question 7

# Question 7

```rust
fn copy_to_prev(v: &mut Vec<i32>, i: usize) {
    let n = &mut v[i];
    *n = v[i - 1];
}
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    copy_to_prev(&mut v, 1);
}
```

Which of the following best describes the undefined behavior that could occur if this program were allowed to execute?

* The assignment `*n` is a use of freed memory
* The borrow `&mut v[i]` creates a pointer to freed memory
* The read of `v[i - 1]` is a use of freed memory
* There is no undefined behavior in this program


---


# Question 7 Answer

```rust
fn copy_to_prev(v: &mut Vec<i32>, i: usize) {
    let n = &mut v[i];
    *n = v[i - 1];
}

fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    copy_to_prev(&mut v, 1);
}
```

* Answer:
    * There is no undefined behavior in this program
* Reason:
    * The borrow checker doesn't know that `v[i]` and `v[i - 1]` point to completely different things


---


# Question 7 Brown Explanation

This program is safe. No undefined behavior could occur if it were executed. (If `i` was outside the bounds of `v`, then Rust will panic at runtime rather than cause undefined behavior.)

The issue is that Rust doesn't know for sure that `v[i]` and `v[i - 1]` are referring to different elements.


---


# Question 8

Which statement is true about the sizes of `s2` and `s3`? Remember, we only care about the amount of data on the _stack_.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2: &String = &s;
    let s3: &str = &s[..];
}
```

 * `s3` has fewer bytes than `s2`
 * `s3` has more bytes than `s2`
 * `s3` has the same number of bytes as `s2`


---


# Question 8 Answer

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let s2: &String = &s;
    let s3: &str = &s[..];
}
```

* Answer:
    * `s3` has more bytes than `s2`
* Reason:
    * `s3` is a string slice, so it stores both a 64-bit pointer and a 64-bit length of the slice
    * `s2` is just a normal 64-bit pointer


---


# Question 9

Determine whether the program will pass the compiler.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}

impl Point {
    fn get_x(&mut self) -> &mut i32 {
      &mut self.x
    }
}
```


---


# Question 9

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}

impl Point {
    fn get_x(&mut self) -> &mut i32 {
      &mut self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let x = p.get_x();
    *x += 1;
    println!("{} {}", *x, p.y);
}
```


---


# Question 9 Answer

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let x = p.get_x();
    *x += 1;
    println!("{} {}", *x, p.y);
}
```

* Answer:
    * `does not compile`


---


# Question 10

Some setup code:

```rust
struct TestResult {
    /// Student's scores on a test
    scores: Vec<usize>,

    /// A possible value to curve all scores
    curve: Option<usize>
}
```


---


# Question 10

```rust
impl TestResult {
    pub fn get_curve(&self) -> &Option<usize> {
        &self.curve
    }

    /// If there is a curve, then increments all
    /// scores by the curve
    pub fn apply_curve(&mut self) {
        if let Some(curve) = self.get_curve() {
            for score in self.scores.iter_mut() {
                *score += *curve;
            }
        }
    }
}
```


---


# Question 10

```rust
/// If there is a curve, then increments all
/// scores by the curve
pub fn apply_curve(&mut self) {
    if let Some(curve) = self.get_curve() {
        for score in self.scores.iter_mut() {
            *score += *curve;
        }
    }
}
```

If you tried to compile this program, which of the following best describes the compiler error you would get?

 * in `get_curve`, cannot return a reference to a local variable `self.curve`
 * in `apply_curve`, cannot borrow `self.scores` as mutable for `iter_mut`
 * in `apply_curve`, cannot borrow `self` as immutable for `get_curve`
 * in `apply_curve`, `*score` cannot be mutated


---


# Question 10 Answer

* Answer:
    * in `apply_curve`, cannot borrow `self.scores` as mutable for `iter_mut`
* Reason:
    * First, try and figure out what the type of `curve` is
    * Second, reason about why the call to `iter_mut` won't compile


---


# Review Summary

* We didn't teach you how to answer those "undefined behavior" problems
* It is important to understand that Rust has all these rules for a good reason
* So what happens when we know our code is safe, but doesn't compile?
    * _If only we had a way to tell the compiler that we know something it doesn't..._
