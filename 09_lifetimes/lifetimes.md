## Intro to Rust Lang

# Lifetimes

<br>

# Today: Lifetimes

We've used the term "lifetime" a few times before, and today we're going to explore what exactly it means.

* What is `'a` lifetime?
* How to think about lifetimes
* Other perspectives...


---


# Lifetimes

Lifetimes are all about references, and **nothing** else.

* Informal definition:
**Lifetimes provide a way for Rust to validate pointers at compile time**

* Formal definition:
**Lifetimes are named regions of code that a reference must be valid for**

* Remember that references are just pointers with constraints!


---


# Lifetimes and References vs Traits and Generics

Lifetimes are similar to trait bounds on generic types.

* Traits ensure that a generic type has the behavior we want
* Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as we need them to be


---


# Validating References

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

The main goal of lifetimes is to prevent _dangling references_.

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

* What is the issue with this code?


---


# Validating References

```
error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough
 --> src/main.rs:6:13
  |
6 |         r = &x;
  |             ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
7 |     }
  |     - `x` dropped here while still borrowed
8 |
9 |     println!("r: {}", r);
  |                       - borrow later used here
```

* The value that `r` refers to has gone out of scope before we could use it
* The scope of `r` is "larger" than the scope of `x`


---


# The Borrow Checker

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

The Rust compiler's borrow checker will compare scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid.

Here is the same code, but with a lifetime diagram:
```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {}", r); //          |
}                         // ---------+
```


---


# The Borrow Checker

![bg right:20% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

The borrow checker will compare the "size" of the two lifetimes

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
    println!("r: {}", r); //          |
}                         // ---------+
```

* `r` has a lifetime of `'a`
* `r` refers to a variable with lifetime `'b`
* Rejects because `'b` is shorter than `'a`


---


# Placating the Borrow Checker

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

We can fix this code by removing the scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // --+-- 'a
                          //   |
    let x = 5;            // ----------+- 'b 
    r = &x;               //   |       |
                          //   |       |
    println!("r: {}", r); //   |       |
                          // --+       |
}                         // ----------+
```

* `x` now "outlives" `r`, so `r` can reference `x`


---


# Generic Lifetimes

Let's try to write some string functions.

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

We want this output:

```
The longest string is abcd
```

* Let's implement `longest`!


---


# `longest`

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Here is a first attempt:

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

* _We don't want to take ownership, so we take `&str` inputs_


---


# `longest` Error

Unfortunately, our attempt will not compile:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:9:33
  |
9 | fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
  |               ----     ----     ^ expected named lifetime parameter

  |           ++++     ++          ++          ++
```


---


# `longest` Error

The help text from the compiler error reveals some useful information:

```
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value,
    but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `x` or `y`
```

* Rust can't figure out if the reference returned refers to `x` or `y`
* In fact, neither do we!


---


# `longest` Error

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

* We don't know which execution path this code will take
* We also don't know the lifetimes of the input references
* Thus we cannot determine the lifetime we return!
* We will need to _annotate_ these references


---


# Lifetime Annotation Syntax

We can annotate lifetimes with generic parameters that start with a `'`, like `'a`.

```rust
&i32          // a reference
&'a i32       // a reference with an explicit annotated lifetime
&'a mut i32   // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime

&'hello usize // annotations can be any word or character,
&'world bool  // as long as it starts with a tick (')
```

* Annotations do not change how long references live, they only describe the _relationship_ between lifetimes of references
    * Think of `'a` as a lower bound for the lifetime of the reference
    * `x: 'a i32` means `x` lives at least as long as some lifetime `'a`
    * Borrow checker identifies if references share a lower bound


---


# `longest` Lifetimes

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Let's return back to our `longest` function.

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

* What do we want the function signature to express?
* What should the relationship be between the lifetimes of the references?


---


# `longest` Lifetimes

What exactly are we returning?

```rust
if x.len() > y.len() {
    x
} else {
    y
}
```

* We return either `x` or `y`, which each have their own lifetimes
* We want the returned reference to be valid as long as _both_ input references `x` and `y` are valid
* So we want lifetimes of `x` and `y` to _outlive_ the returned lifetime

<!--
In other words, we do not want the thing we return to outlive `x` or `y`
-->


---


# `longest` Lifetimes

![bg right:25% 75%](../images/ferris_happy.svg)

Since lifetimes are a kind of generic parameter, we must declare them like normal generic type parameters.

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

* This will compile now!
* _Note that these lifetime annotations don't **change** any lifetimes, they just **restrict**_

<!--
They just tell the borrow checker to reject any values that don't adhere to these constraints/invariants
-->


---


# Lifetime Annotations in Functions

We can extrapolate a lot from a function's signature, even without the body.

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str;
```

* This function takes two string slices (`x` and `y`) that live at least as long as the lifetime `'a`
* The string slice returned (the longer of `x` or `y`) will also live at least as long as `'a`


---


# Lifetime Annotations in Functions

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str;
```

* When calling `longest`, the lifetime that is substituted for `'a` is the intersection of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`
* In practice, this means the lifetime returned by `longest` is the same as the **smaller** of the two input lifetimes

<!--
Be clear that functions do not "return" lifetimes, this is just for slide space.

In general, the relationship between lifetimes and scope is total,
basically they do not overlap in some parts but not in others.

However, there are some cases where this might be the case, usually quite complex

Note that the longest function doesnâ€™t need to know exactly how long x and y will live, only that some scope can be substituted for 'a that will satisfy this signature.
This is a more complicated topic that probably shouldn't be brought up.
-->


---


# Borrow Checker Example 1

Let's look at some examples where the borrow checker is and isn't happy.

```rust
let string1 = String::from("long string is long");

{
    let string2 = String::from("xyz");

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

* `string1` is valid in the outer scope, `string2` is valid in the inner scope
* `result` should only be  valid in the smaller scope (by our lifetime annotations)
    * Since `println!` is in the smaller (inner) scope, this works!


---


# Borrow Checker Example 2

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Let's reorder some things around.

```rust
let result;
let string1 = String::from("xyz");

{
    let string2 = String::from("long string is long");
    result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
}

println!("The longest string is {}", result);
```

* `result` should only be valid in the smaller (inner) scope, but we try to reference it in the outer scope

<!--
`result` doesn't need to be `mut` because we haven't assigned it anything yet
-->


---


# Borrow Checker Example 2

Sure enough, this does not compile! Rust gives us this error:

```
error[E0597]: `string2` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:7:44
   |
6  |         let string2 = String::from("long string is long");

```


---


# Borrow Checker Example 3

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

What if we knew (as the programmer) that `string1` is always longer than `string2`?

Let's switch the strings around:
```rust
let result;
let string1 = String::from("long string is long"); // Longer!

{
    let string2 = String::from("xyz"); // Shorter!
    result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
}

println!("The longest string is {}", result);
```


---


# Borrow Checker Example 3

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

```rust
let result;
let string1 = String::from("long string is long"); // Longer!

{
    let string2 = String::from("xyz"); // Shorter!
    result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
}

println!("The longest string is {}", result);
```

* Even though we know (as humans) that the reference will be valid, the compiler does not know

<!--
* We even told the compiler that the returned lifetime would be the same as the smaller of the input lifetimes!
-->


---


# Avoiding Lifetime Annotations

Suppose we wanted to always return the first input, `x`.

```rust
fn first<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    x
}
```

* We don't need to annotate `y` with `'a`, because the return value doesn't care about `y`'s lifetime


---


# Lifetimes of Return Values

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

The lifetime of a return value _must_ match the lifetime of one of the inputs.

```rust
fn dangling<'a>(x: &str, y: &str) -> &'a str {

    let result = String::from("really long string");

    // What lifetime would we give this `&str`?
    result.as_str()

}
```

* If it didn't depend on an input, then it would _always_ be a dangling reference!

<!--
In other words, all valid references must be _derived_ from other valid references.
-->


---


# Lifetime Elision

All references must have a lifetime. But we've seen many references without lifetime annotations...

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

* There are no lifetime annotations here!

<!--
This is a function we saw back in week 2
-->


---


# Story Time

_Long ago, in the dark ages of the 2010s, every reference needed an explicit lifetime._

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
```

* Before Rust 1.0, every single `&` needed an explicit `'something` annotation
* This became incredibly repetitive, and so the Rust team programmed the borrow checker to infer lifetime annotation patterns of certain situations
* These patterns are called the _lifetime elision rules_


---


# Lifetime Elision

* Lifetime elision does not provide full inference, it will only infer when it is absolutely sure it is correct
* Lifetimes on function or method arguments are called **input lifetimes**, and lifetimes on return values are called **output lifetimes**
* There are only 3 lifetime elision rules, the first for input lifetimes, the last two for output lifetimes


---


# Lifetime Elision Rule 1

The first rule is that the compiler will assign a different lifetime parameter for each input lifetime.

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32);
fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32);

fn bar(x: &i32, y: &i32);
fn bar<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32);
```


---


# Lifetime Elision Rule 2

The second rule is that if there is only 1 input lifetime parameter, then it is assigned to all output lifetimes.

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) -> &i32;
fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32;

fn bar(arr: &[i32]) -> (&i32, &i32);
fn bar<'a>(arr: &'a [i32]) -> (&'a i32, &'a i32);
```


---


# Lifetime Elision Rule 3

If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but the first parameter is `&self` or `&mut self`, the lifetime of `&self` is assigned to all output lifetimes.

* This only applies to methods
* Makes writing methods much nicer!
* _Examples to come later..._


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 1

Let's pretend we are the compiler, and let's attempt to apply the lifetime elision rules to `first_word`.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str;
```


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 1

We apply the first rule, which specifies that each parameter gets its own lifetime.

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str;
```


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 1

The second rule specifies that the lifetime of the single input parameter gets assigned to all output lifetimes, so the signature becomes this:

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str;
```

* Since all references have lifetime annotations, we're done!


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 2

So why didn't elision work with `longest`? Let's trace it out!

We start with this signature without annotations:

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str;
```


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 2

Let's apply the first rule and get annotations for all inputs.

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str;
```

* What now?


---


# Lifetime Elision Example 2

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str;
```

- The second rule doesn't apply here, because there is more than 1 input lifetime (`'a` and `'b`)
* Since Rust cannot figure out what to do, it gives a compiler error to the programmer so they can write the annotations themselves


---


# Lifetimes in Structs

So far, all of the `struct`s we've looked at have held _owned_ type fields.

If we want a `struct` to hold a reference, we need to annotate them.

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
    importance: i32,
}

let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
let first_sentence: &str = novel.split('.').next().expect("No periods");

let important = ImportantExcerpt {
    part: first_sentence,
    importance: 42,
};
```


---


# Lifetimes in Structs

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
    importance: i32,
}
```

- As with generic data types, we declare the name of the generic lifetime parameter inside angle brackets
* This annotation means an instance of `ImportantExcerpt` canâ€™t outlive the reference it holds in its `part` field


---


# Lifetimes in `impl` Blocks

Similarly, we need to annotate `impl` blocks with lifetime parameters.

```rust
impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn importance(&self) -> i32 {
        self.importance
    }
}
```


---


# Lifetimes in Methods

Here is an example where the third elision rule is applied:

```rust
impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }
}
```

* The first rule gives both `&self` and `announcement` their own lifetimes
* The third rule gives the return lifetime the lifetime of `&self`


---


# Putting it all together...

Letâ€™s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!

```rust
fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str, ann: T) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);

    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```


---


# Lifetime Bounds

Lifetimes can be bounds, just like traits.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Ref<'a, T: 'a>(&'a T);
```

* `Ref` contains a reference, with a lifetime of `'a`, to a generic type `T`
* `T` is bounded such that any references _in_ `T` must live at least as long as `'a`
* Additionally, the lifetime of `Ref` may not exceed `'a`

<!--
Note that these lifetime bound slides are REALLY not that important.
-->


---


# Lifetime Bounds

Here is a similar example, but with a function instead of a `struct`.

```rust
fn print_ref<'a, T>(t: &'a T)
where
    T: Debug + 'a,
{
    println!("print_ref(t) is {:?}", t);
}
```

* `T` must implement `Debug`, and all references _in_ `T` must outlive `'a`
* Additionally, `'a` must outlive this function call


---


# Lifetime Bounds

Putting the `Ref` and `print_ref` together:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Ref<'a, T: 'a>(&'a T);

fn print_ref<'a, T>(t: &'a T) where T: Debug + 'a {
    println!("print_ref(t) is {:?}", t);
}

let x = vec![9, 8, 0, 0, 8];
let ref_x = Ref(&x);
print_ref(&ref_x);
```

```
print_ref(t) is Ref([9, 8, 0, 0, 8])
```

<!--
This is quite difficult to understand, don't spend too much time here.
-->


---


# Lifetime-bounded Lifetimes

We can have lifetimes that are bounded by other lifetimes.

```rust
// Takes in a `&'a i32` and return a `&'b i32` as a result of coercion
fn choose_first<'a: 'b, 'b>(first: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'b i32 {
    first
}

fn main() {
    let first = 2; // Longer lifetime
    {
        let second = 3; // Shorter lifetime
        println!("{} is the first", choose_first(&first, &second));
    }
}
```

* `'a: 'b` reads as "lifetime `'a` outlives `'b`"

<!--
'a outlives 'b == 'a is at least as long as 'b
-->


---


# The `'static` Lifetime

There is a special lifetime called `'static`.

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime";
```

* `'static` implies that the reference will live until the end of the program (it is valid until the program stops running)
* Here, `s` is stored in the program binary, so it will always be valid!


---


# `'static` Error Messages

You may see suggestions to use the `'static` lifetime in error messages.

```rust
fn foo() -> &i32 {
    let x = 5;
    &x
}
```

```
help: consider using the `'static` lifetime, but this is uncommon unless you're
      returning a borrowed value from a `const` or a `static`
  |
2 | fn foo() -> &'static i32 {
  |              +++++++
```


---


# `'static` Error Messages

  |
2 | fn foo() -> &'static i32 {

```

* Before making a change, think about if your reference will _really_ live until the end of the program
* You may actually be trying to create a dangling reference!


---


# `'static` vs `static`

There are two common ways to make a variable with a `'static` lifetime.

1) Make a string literal with has type `&'static str`
2) Make a constant with the `static` declaration


---


# `'static` vs `static` Example

```rust
static NUM: i32 = 42;
static NUM_REF: &'static i32 = &NUM;

fn main() {
    let msg: &'static str = "Hello World";
    println!("{msg} {NUM_REF}!");
}
```

```
Hello World 42!
```

<!--
If time allows, explain the difference between `const` and `static`.
-->


---


# `'static` Memory Leaks

There is a third way: we can create `'static` values by _leaking memory_.

```rust
fn random_vec() -> &'static [usize; 100] {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let mut boxed = Box::new([0; 100]);
    boxed.try_fill(&mut rng).unwrap();
    Box::leak(boxed)
}

let first: &'static [usize; 100] = random_vec();
let second: &'static [usize; 100] = random_vec();
assert_ne!(first, second)
```

* This allows us to _dynamically_ create a `'static` reference
* _Note that leaking memory is NOT undefined behavior!_

<!--
Make sure to explain that leaking memory is NOT UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR. Memory corruption cannot happen
just because memory has been leaked. On most operating systems nowadays, if you start running out of
memory the OS is just going to kill your process.

# The `'static` Bound

`'static` can also be used as a type bound. However...

* There is a subtle difference between the `'static` lifetime and the `'static` bound
* The `'static` bound means that the type does not contain any non-static references
* This means that all owned data implicitly has a `'static` bound, since owned data holds no references

<!--
Does not imply contrapositive

# `'static` Bound Example

![bg right:20% 90%](../images/ferris_does_not_compile.svg)

Here's an example of using a `'static` bound.

```rust
fn print_it(input: impl Debug + 'static) {
    println!("'static value passed in is: {:?}", input);
}

fn main() {
    // `i` is owned and contains no references,
    // thus it has a 'static bound.
    let i = 5;
    print_it(i);

    // Oops, `&i` only has the lifetime defined by
    // the scope of main, so it's not 'static.
    print_it(&i);
}
```

# `'static` Bound Example

We get a compiler error:

```
error[E0597]: `i` does not live long enough
  --> src/lib.rs:15:15
   |
15 |     print_it(&i);
   |     ---------^^--
   |     |         |
   |     |         borrowed value does not live long enough
   |     argument requires that `i` is borrowed for `'static`
16 | }
   | - `i` dropped here while still borrowed
```

# Review

* Rust has lifetimes to prevent dangling references
* The borrow checker will ensure that lifetimes are always valid
* Rust will allow you elide lifetime annotations in some situations


---


# Further Reading

* You can find some more examples here: [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html)
* If you want to go _really_ in depth, read the Rustonomicon chapters on [lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html)

# Another Perspective

[**What is 'a lifetime?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRAVZv7V91Q)

* This is a great video made by `leddoo` that explains another way to think about lifetimes!
* Instead of lifetimes as regions of code or scopes, what if we thought about lifetimes as regions of memory?
* Let's watch it together!

# What is `'a` lifetime?

Some quick points:

* Thinking about lifetimes as regions of code can be confusing
* Instead, think about lifetimes as regions of valid memory
* Both interpretations are valid!

# Homework 9

* In this homework, you will be following a live-coding stream on YouTube:
    * [Crust of Rust: Lifetime Annotations](https://youtu.be/rAl-9HwD858?si=VTQfI8Re7DvrtDqy)
* Jon Gjengset is a well-known educator in the Rust community
    * _He is also the inspiration for a lot of content in the second half of this course!_
* The livestream is 1.5 hours, but the writeup shows sections you can skip
    * We would recommend watching the livestream and _then_ writing code!
* This homework is more about getting the tests to compile
    * _You'll only need to write about 20-30 lines of code!_
