## Intro to Rust Lang

# Macros!

# Macros Spotted!

We've seen a few macros so far...

* `println!()`
* `assert!()` and `assert_eq!()`
* `panic!()` and `todo!()`
* `vec![]`


---


# Hiding in Plain Sight

A few things that we haven't explicitly called macros are actually macros in disguise!

* `#[derive(Debug)]`
* `#[cfg(test)]` and `#[test]`


---


# Macros!

* 3 Levels of Metaprogramming
* Declarative Macros
* The `vec![]` Macro
* Intro to Procedural Macros


---


# Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming is essentially writing code that writes code.

More precisely, it is a programming technique where computer programs treat other programs as their data.

* This can mean generating a program from a program (code generation)
* Or it could mean a program modifying itself
* _Today we will focus on the latter example_


---


# Level 1: Metaprogramming in C

C's metaprogramming is mostly restricted to C macros.

* C compilers like `gcc` and `clang` come with a _C preprocessor_
* However you define the macro is how it is expanded
* Simple but powerful


---


# C Macros

You use the `define` directive to create object-like macros in C. Every invocation of the macro that is defined "expands" to its definition.

```c
#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
void *page = malloc(PAGE_SIZE);
//      -> = malloc(4096);
```

```c
#define NUMBERS 1, \
                2, \
                3
int x[] = { NUMBERS };
     â†’  = { 1, 2, 3 };
```

```c
#define MAX(X, Y)  ((X) > (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
x = MAX(a, b);          â†’  x = ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b));
y = MAX(1, 2);          â†’  y = ((1) > (2) ? (1) : (2));
z = MAX(a + 28, *p);    â†’  z = ((a + 28) > (*p) ? (a + 28) : (*p));
```

<!--
This last example is actually also wrong, but it's on the gnu website so...
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macro-Arguments.html

If you do `MAX(x++, y++)`...
-->


---


# What's Wrong With This Picture?

```c
#define TWICE(x) 2*x

TWICE(3)    â†’    2*3
```

* What happens when you write `TWICE(1 + x)`?
    * Expands to `2 * 1 + x`
    * We probably wanted `2 * (1 + x)`...


---


# `#define`

* The `define` directive can be powerful, but can also be easily misused
* Generally* C macros cannot go beyond what a programmer could write themselves manually
* C macros are unaware* of types, scope, and even variable names
* _`#define` is literally just string manipulation_


---


# Level 2: C++ Metaprogramming

C++ is a much more expressive language than C, so how does it approach metaprogramming differently?

* C++ is mostly a superset of C, so it still has `#define` ðŸ˜”
* C++ has a feature called _Template Metaprogramming_


---


# C++ Templates

C++ offers a potential solution to writing generic code:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T max(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

max(10, 20);
max(10.11, 20.22);
```

* C++ templates will generate a version of the templated function for every type that needs to use the function
* Seem familiar?


---


# C++ Error Messages

What happens if we're not so careful with the types?

```cpp
max(10, 20.0);
```

```cpp
test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
test.cpp:12:8: error: no matching function for call to 'max(int, double)'
   12 |     max(10, 20.2);
      |     ~~~^~~~~~~~~~
test.cpp:5:3: note: candidate: 'template<class T> T max(T, T)'
    5 | T max(T a, T b) {
      |   ^~~
test.cpp:5:3: note:   template argument deduction/substitution failed:
test.cpp:12:8: note:   deduced conflicting types for parameter 'T' ('int' and 'double')
   12 |     max(10, 20.2);
      |     ~~~^~~~~~~~~~
```

* Not terrible...


---


# C++ ERROR Messages

What about this?

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int a;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> v;
    std::find(v.begin(), v.end(), a);
}
```

* _Brace for impact_

# C++ Templates

* C++ Templates (right now) are more powerful than Rust Generics
    * _C++ Templates are even Turing-complete!_
* Powerful, but not exactly the most ergonomic
* Very similar to Rust in nature, can be different in practice


---


# TODO

* Talk about Rust metaprogramming via generics and const generics
* Errors caught at compile time... but really caught long before C++
* Generics are type checked
* What if we could generate our own compile-time generated code that was type safe?
* Rust Macros fill this gap
* Introduce declarative macros
* Some basic patterns
* `vec![]` macro
* Procedural macros if I have time to write it


---


# Level 3: Rust Metaprogramming

We've already seen metaprogramming in Rust through Generics.

```rust
use std::cmp::PartialOrd;

fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
```

* Rust generates monomorphized versions of this function for each type that we need it for


---


# `#[derive(...)]`

We have also seen metaprogramming through the `derive` attribute, which can generate trait implementations for us.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Student {
    andrew_id: String,
    attendance: Vec<bool>,
    grade: u8,
    stress_level: u64,
}
```

* Same idea, the `Debug` trait is implemented for us at compile time


---


# `println!(...)`

Finally, we've seen function-like macros:

```rust
println!("hello");
println!("hello {}", name);
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4, "Math broken?");
```

* The main difference between these function-like macros and normal functions is the variadic parameters


---


# Rust Macros

* Macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning of code
* This means that Rust macros can:
  * Implement a trait on some type
  * Statically evaluate code
  * _Modify the Abstract Syntax Tree_
* Macros are called at compile time, whereas functions are called at runtime


---


# Macros Everywhere?

Macros are strictly more powerful than functions because of their ability to execute during compile time.

So why not just use macros everywhere?

* Macro definitions are far more complex than function definitions
  * _You're writing Rust code that writes Rust code!_
* Macros are much more difficult to read, understand, and maintain


<!--
Also, you must define macros or bring them into scope before using,
vs function which you can define anywhere and call anywhere
-->


---


# 2 Types of Macros

Rust has 2 main types of macros.

* Declarative Macros
* Procedural Macros (3 sub-categories)
  * Custom `#[derive]` macros
  * Attribute-like macros
  * Function-like macros operating on tokens


---


# Declarative Macros

Declarative macros are the most widely used form of macros in Rust.

* At a high level, declarative macros allow you to write something similar to a `match` expression
* The only difference is that instead of `match`ing expressions, we `match` Rust source code
* We use the `macro_rules!` construct to define declarative macros


---


# `macro_rules!`

TODO simple example
